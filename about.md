I work as a data scientist at [scoutbee](https://scoutbee.com/), a B2B
procurement startup. Right now I work remotely from Austin, TX.

My freetime activities:
- reading
- playing the piano
- playing super smash bros

I have a personal kanban board of all the things I want to learn on
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and I use [Complice](https://complice.co/) to
make sure that my daily tasks are oriented with my longer-term goals.
