title:  "Extract Keywords from Text Snippets using TF-IDF and Scikit-Learn"
date:   2019-01-15

TF-IDF, which stands for **term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency**, is a statistical method that determines the relative importance of a word in a snippet in the context of a list of snippets. We can use it to find keywords.

TF-IDF will give low scores to words in a snippet that are too frequent (eg. stopwords like "a", "and", "the") and also words that do not occur too often in the snippet. TF-IDF will give high scores to words that are relatively rare in the context of other snippets but also occur often in the given snippet.

TF-IDF keyword extraction is useful for:
- Automatic tag generation of a social media post
- Finding websites similar to a given website (document similarity)
- Bag-of-word text classification models
- ...and many more!

We will use the IMDB movie dataset that you can download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data).


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
```


```python
df = pd.read_csv('IMDB-Movie-Data.csv')[['Title', 'Description']]
df.sample(5)
```

## Snippet vectorization (preprocessing + tokenization)

Raw descriptions aren't too useful. We need to process the descriptions into a usable format, ie. clean and tokenize. Luckily for us, `scikit-learn` takes care of this for us. When we call `vectorizer.fit_transform()` on our raw descriptions, it will clean and tokenize the text under-the-hood.


```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
snippet_scores = vectorizer.fit_transform(df.Description)

# Note we have 1000 snippets with 5897 unique words (or tokens)
snippet_scores.shape
```




    (1000, 5897)



## Keyword extraction

Features in the below cell means the words (or tokens) found in the text. We call `vectorizer.get_feature_names()` so we can save them into an array which we will use later to retrieve the keyword from its index.


```python
features = np.array(vectorizer.get_feature_names())
np.random.choice(features, 5)
```




    array(['cleanses', 'sky', 'inflatable', 'except', 'pandemic'], dtype='<U17')



Next we do a bit of array mangling in order to extract out the keywords.


```python
def top_n_keywords(scores, features, n=5):
    tfidf_sorting = np.argsort(scores.toarray()).flatten()[::-1]
    return features[tfidf_sorting][:n]
```


```python
df['Top 5 Keywords'] = [top_n_keywords(scores, features) for scores in snippet_scores]
df.sample(5)
```
